# Sorting algorithms comparison

Instructions to run the program:
1. ```cd``` into the program directory.
2. Run the command ```make```.
3. The command ```./main``` will print the output including run time of different sorting algorithms regarding different input sizes.
4. The comamnd ```./main > data.csv``` will export the data, including run time of different sorting algorithms regarding different input sizes, into data.csv file.
5. To plot the result, run the file plot.py
6. To clean objects file or executable file from the directory, run the command ```make clean```.

The result was plotted and analyzed in the file Analysis.pdf.
